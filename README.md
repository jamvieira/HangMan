# HangMan
This Repo is to showcase one of my projects while I was learning coding at bootcamp Academia de CÃ³digo in Lisbon

Terminal hangman game made in Java, while learning the language.


To Start the game you will need to run the server, and then run the client in 2 seperate instances, where one of the client will be able to choose a word and the other one will be able to guess it!
